Leveraging data from Netflix's published dataset, I executed acomprehensive data pipeline to deliver actionable insights. Starting in Excel, I cleaned and prepared the data by splitting columns, trimming values, and replacing inconsistent entries. In SQL, I optimized the dataset by creating relational tables, adding new insights, and streamlining its structure. I then connected this SQL database to Power BI, made some adjustments to the relationships, and created an interactive dashboard with maps, bar charts, slicers, and action buttons. This dashboard showcases key information such as release dates, ratings, availability by country, and popular categories. It helps consumers discover content theyâ€™ll enjoy and provides Netflix with valuable insights into high-demand titles, top-rated content, and viewing trends, supporting data-driven decisions.
